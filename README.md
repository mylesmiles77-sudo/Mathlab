### The "Perfect" Algorithm: A Master Development Blueprint

This algorithm outlines the entire process from start to finish, focusing on architecture and logic. It's a plan for building the app itself.

**Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture**

1.  **Initialize Project**
    *   Choose a technology stack (e.g., Swift/SwiftUI for iOS, Kotlin/Jetpack Compose for Android, React/TypeScript for Web).
    *   Create a new project named "Mathematics Lab".
    *   Set up a Version Control System (e.g., Git) with an initial commit.

2.  **Design the Data Model**
    *   Define a `Calculation` class/struct to store:
        *   `expression: String` (e.g., "2 + sin(30)")
        *   `result: String` (e.g., "2.5")
        *   `timestamp: DateTime`
    *   Define a `CalculatorMode` enum: `SIMPLE`, `SCIENTIFIC`, `PROGRAMMER`.
    *   Define a `Formula` class/struct for the library:
        *   `title: String` (e.g., "Quadratic Formula")
        *   `expression: String` (e.g., "x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a")
        *   `category: String` (e.g., "Algebra")

3.  **Build the Core Calculation Engine**
    *   Create a `CalculationEngine` module. This is the brain of the app.
    *   **Key Function:** `evaluate(expression: String, mode: CalculatorMode) -> Result<String, Error>`
        *   It takes a string expression and the current mode.
        *   It parses the string, validates it, and computes the result.
        *   It returns a `Result` type containing the answer or an error message (e.g., "Division by zero", "Invalid expression").
    *   **Implementation Note:** For complex expression parsing, consider using a library like `Math.js` (for web) or `Expression` (for iOS) or writing a Shunting-yard algorithm parser to handle operator precedence and functions correctly.

**Phase 2: User Interface Implementation**

4.  **Create the Main Application Layout**
    *   Implement a `MainView` component.
    *   The `MainView` state should hold:
        *   `currentMode: CalculatorMode` (initialized to `SIMPLE`)
        *   `currentDisplay: String` (the input and output string)
        *   `history: [Calculation]` (list of past calculations)

5.  **Implement the Dynamic Calculator Interface**
    *   **Algorithm for `renderButtonLayout(mode):`**
        ```
        function renderButtonLayout(mode) {
            buttonLayout = []
            commonButtons = ["C", "(", ")", "±", "%", "=", "0", "1", "2"... "9", ".", "+", "-", "*", "/"]

            if mode == SIMPLE:
                buttonLayout = commonButtons + ["√", "MC", "MR", "M+", "M-"]
            else if mode == SCIENTIFIC:
                buttonLayout = commonButtons + [
                    "sin", "cos", "tan", "log", "ln", "π", "e", "x^y", "x!", "1/x"
                ]
            else if mode == PROGRAMMER:
                buttonLayout = ["C", "HEX", "DEC", "OCT", "BIN", "AND", "OR", "NOT", "XOR", "<<" ...] // Number pad is context-aware
            return createButtons(buttonLayout)
        }
        ```
    *   Create a `CalculatorButton` component that is reusable for different styles (number, operation, function).

6.  **Implement the Toggle Mechanism**
    *   Create a `ModeToggle` component (e.g., a segmented control or three styled buttons).
    *   **Algorithm for `onModeChange(newMode):`**
        ```
        function onModeChange(newMode) {
            // 1. Update the currentMode state to newMode.
            // 2. Clear the currentDisplay or reset to a default state for the new mode.
            // 3. The UI will re-render, calling renderButtonLayout(newMode) to show the correct buttons.
        }
        ```

**Phase 3: Feature Integration**

7.  **Integrate the Calculation Engine with UI**
    *   **Algorithm for `onButtonPress(buttonValue):`**
        ```
        function onButtonPress(buttonValue) {
            switch(buttonValue) {
                case "=":
                    // Send currentDisplay string to CalculationEngine.evaluate()
                    result = CalculationEngine.evaluate(currentDisplay, currentMode)
                    if result is success:
                        append " = [result]" to display and save to history.
                    else:
                        show error message.
                    break;
                case "C":
                    clear currentDisplay.
                    break;
                // ... handle other special buttons (MC, M+, etc.)
                default:
                    // For most buttons (numbers, operators, functions)
                    append buttonValue to the currentDisplay string.
            }
        }
        ```

8.  **Build the Equation Solver Module**
    *   Create a new `EquationSolverView`.
    *   It presents a form to the user (e.g., "Select Equation Type: Linear | Quadratic").
    *   Based on the selection, it shows relevant input fields (e.g., for `a`, `b`, `c` in a quadratic equation).
    *   **Algorithm for `solveEquation(type, coefficients):`**
        *   Uses the `CalculationEngine` or a dedicated solver function.
        *   Applies the correct formula (e.g., quadratic formula) and returns the roots.

9.  **Build the Formula Library & Logarithm Books**
    *   Create a `FormulaLibraryView`.
    *   Populate a local database (e.g., a JSON file) with `Formula` objects.
    *   Implement a search bar that filters the list of formulas by `title` or `category`.
    *   The Logarithm Book can be a specialized section within this library or a separate view that displays pre-rendered tables.

**Phase 4: Polishing & Deployment**

10. **Add History & Memory**
    *   Implement the logic for `MC` (Memory Clear), `MR` (Memory Recall), `M+` (Memory Add), `M-` (Memory Subtract). This will require a `memory: Double` state variable.
    *   Display a scrollable list of the `history` array.

11. **Error Handling & Input Validation**
    *   Ensure the `CalculationEngine` robustly handles malformed inputs and edge cases (division by zero, log of a negative number, etc.) and returns user-friendly errors.

12. **Testing, Styling, and Release**
    *   Thoroughly test all modes and features.
    *   Apply final UI/UX styling to make it visually appealing and intuitive.
    *   Build the production version and deploy to the respective app store or web server.

This algorithm provides a complete, step-by-step roadmap. The key to its "perfection" is its **modularity**. The `CalculationEngine` is separate from the UI. The `CalculatorMode` drives the interface. New features like a graphing calculator or a matrix solver can be added by extending the `CalculatorMode` enum and following the same patterns.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific phase, such as the detailed logic for the `evaluate()` function in the `CalculationEngine`?
